\title{Euclid Science with Strong Gravitational Lenses}

\author{The Euclid Consortium Strong Lensing Science Working Group}

\maketitle

% -----------------------------------------------------------------------------

\begin{abstract}
\noindent Euclid will image \emph{a lot of sky} at \emph{high resolution}. This dataset
will contain {\it a large number} of lenses of various types, enabling a variety 
of different  science investigations. In this white paper we describe a set of
key projects, that exercise the unique capability of Euclid coupled to a large
array of gravitational lenses, that we plan to carry out using the Euclid
dataset, outlining the motivation, expectations and technical challenges
associated with each one.

\section{Introduction}

{\bf Responsible: Fred}

Strong lensing as a tool for studying the universe and its contents. 
Unique capabilities of Euclid coupled to strong lenses. How our 
work fits with other working groups. 

Why are we writing this paper? And why are we writing it now?

Technical challenges. History of finding, challenge of Euclid. History of 
measurement/modeling, challenge of Euclid.

Goals of this paper.

This paper is organized as follows. In Section~\ref{sec:yield} we assess the 
potential of the Euclid dataset, calculating the expected abundance of a 
number of different strong gravitational lenses detectable with Euclid. With 
this in hand, we then 
describe, in Sections~\ref{sec:astrophysics} and~\ref{sec:cosmology}, a set 
of strong lensing science projects that we plan to do using the Euclid data.

\noindent{\bf Responsible: Leon and Max}

Galaxy-scale = anything with $ M_{\odot} < 10^{12}$

Groups, clusters $ 10^{13}< M_{\odot} < 10^{15}$

Forecasts for lens numbers, of various kinds, to various signal-to-noise ratios. 

Subsamples that science will depend on.

For deep fields, wide fields.

\section{Discussion and Conclusions} 
\label{sec:conclusions}

In this section we survey the science projects introduced and assessed in this 
work, identify a number of common challenges that we face, and use these to 
assign ourselves a number of high priority tasks to be carried out before the
first data release.

\subsection{Common Challenges}

These will emerge as we write about our science projects.


\subsection{High Priority Tasks}

These will be defined once we have written down the challenges.


\subsection{Conclusions}

The Euclid dataset should contain some XXX lenses, enabling the key science
projects described in this paper and more. Just focusing on these key projects,
we conclude the following:

\begin{itemize}

\item XXX is really important and so we will need to do YYY.

\item The challenge of XXX is daunting. We will need to do YYY.

\item XXX is very promising, but to realize its potential we will need YYY.

\end{itemize}
